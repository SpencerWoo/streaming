    Write a program that prints out the phrase "Hello World"

    
NEW CONCEPTS

    Printing
        In programming, "Printing" means that you make text appear in your output window.
        Python has a built-in function called "print()" which will print some text for you.
        Use the "print()" function by putting a string of text inside of the ()
    
    Strings
        In programming we usually put text in quotes, like "this" or "this sentence right here!"
        This is called a "string". Basically, it's just some words inside of quotes.
        Strings help the program understand that something is just plain text, rather than being code it should analyze.

    Running your Code
        To run your code in VSCode, press F5. 
        This will run through all of your code, from top to bottom.

    Comments
        Any line of code that starts with a # character is a "comment", which means it doesn't actually do anything.
        Comments are basically a way to add notes into your code, it's just there to help you or others understand the code better.
        Feel free to write additional comments in the code.
'''

# This is an example of a comment!
# The # at the beginning ensures this line of code doesn't do anything.

print("Example print!")
